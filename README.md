# run-club-web

Hello! This is the web version of Run Club, the up-and-coming Tinder for running buddies and Uber for group runs! Hang in with us as it's built! (please rewrite, lol)

## Stage 2

Okay, back to create-react-app! Thank you Wes Bos for the node course, I don't want to look at Pug files like ever again though, lol.

## Stage 1

I'd started a create-react-app version, but needed to take a step back and properly learn how to interface with MongoDB from Express (though I've got my eye on some other technologies,) and so to cement what I just learned and have something up that's functional, I'm going to build up to where I'm at in the [Learn Node](learnnode.com) course from Wes Bos, and refactor from there.

Also, I just learned how to use dotenv, and so hopefully won't commit my auth, db, google maps, etc keys to a public repo this time, LOL!
